Lab 3 (Optional) Build a declaration from scratch
=================================================

Up to this point we've given you the necessary declaration needed to onboard your **BIGIP**.

In this lab you will start from a blank state and build the declaration on your own.  Use the F5 schema reference and the published schema validation for
declarative onboarding to help you accomplish the task below.

Onboard a standalone **BIGIP** that includes the following in the declaration:
Licensing for the **BIGIP**
DNS
NTP
Regular user
Provision LTM, DNS
Internal VLAN
Non floating self IP on internal VLAN
External VLAN
Non floating self IP on external VLAN
Syslog destination
Enable autoPhonehome
Enable an advisory mess in the **BIGIP** UI
